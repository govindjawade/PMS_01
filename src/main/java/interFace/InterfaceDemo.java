package interFace;
//Key Points:
//Interfaces define a contract: Any class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all its methods.
//Multiple inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces, which allows for a form of multiple inheritance.
//No constructors: Interfaces cannot have constructors because they cannot be instantiated.
//        variable: All fields in an interface are implicitly public, static, and final.
//method:public and abstract but java 8 mai static kar sakte hai

//class -class>>extends
//interface-interface>>extends
//interface-class >>implements
